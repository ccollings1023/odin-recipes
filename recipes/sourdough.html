        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4.75 cups bread flour, or more as needed</li>
            <li>3 Tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>2.5 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 packet active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup warm milk</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons margarine, softened</li>
            <li>1.5 cups sourdough starter</li>
            <li>1 extra large egg</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon water</li>
            <li>.25 cup chopped onion</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine 1 cup flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in a large bowl.
             Add warm milk and margarine. Stir in starter. Mix in remaining
              3 3/4 cups flour gradually; you may need to add more flour depending
               on the climate.
            </li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 8 to 10 minutes.
                 Place dough into a greased bowl, turn once to oil surface,
                  and cover. Allow to rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>Punch down dough; cover and let rest for 15 minutes. Divide dough
                 in half and shape into 2 loaves. Place loaves on a greased baking pan.
                  Allow to rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F</li>
            <li>Stir together egg and water in a small bowl until well combined.
                 Brush over the tops of loaves, then sprinkle with onion.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until loaves are golden brown and cooked through,
                 about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a
                  loaf should read 190 degrees F (88 degrees C).
            </li>
        </ol>
